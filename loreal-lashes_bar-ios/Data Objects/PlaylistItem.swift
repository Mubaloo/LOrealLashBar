/**
 Playlist Items are those with associated videos. This protocol must be adopted for an
 item to be displayed in the Playlist screen as it includes properties to indicate if 
 it is currently a member of the playlist, the location of its video both remotely and
 locally, a thumbnail image and an ordinal to determine the order of appearance in the
 list. Note that adopting this protocol does not automatically make an object available
 on the Playlist screen, it merely ensures that the playlist screen can display it once
 it has been manually included there.
